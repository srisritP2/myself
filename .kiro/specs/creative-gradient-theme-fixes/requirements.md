# Creative Gradient Theme Fixes - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Creative Gradient theme is experiencing white background issues and contains duplicate/conflicting CSS code that prevents the theme from displaying properly. This spec addresses the systematic cleanup and standardization of the theme system to ensure the Creative Gradient theme displays correctly with its animated gradient background and glass morphism effects.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove White Background Conflicts

**User Story:** As a user viewing the Creative Gradient theme, I want to see the animated gradient background instead of white backgrounds, so that the theme displays as intended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Creative Gradient theme is active THEN no white backgrounds should be visible on any elements
2. WHEN viewing the portfolio THEN the animated gradient background should be visible behind all content
3. WHEN inspecting CSS THEN no conflicting background-color declarations should override the theme
4. IF there are CSS conflicts THEN the Creative Gradient theme should have the highest specificity

### Requirement 2: Eliminate Duplicate CSS Code

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want clean, non-duplicated CSS code, so that the theme system is maintainable and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing CSS files THEN there should be no duplicate CSS rules or selectors
2. WHEN the Creative Gradient theme loads THEN it should not conflict with other CSS imports
3. WHEN examining the codebase THEN CSS should follow a clear hierarchy and organization
4. IF duplicate rules exist THEN they should be consolidated into a single, authoritative source

### Requirement 3: Establish Proper CSS Import Order

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CSS imports to load in the correct order, so that theme overrides work properly without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN CSS imports should follow the correct cascade order
2. WHEN Vuetify styles load THEN they should not override Creative Gradient theme styles
3. WHEN the Creative Gradient theme is active THEN it should have final authority over styling
4. IF there are import order issues THEN they should be resolved with proper sequencing

### Requirement 4: Standardize Theme Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer working with themes, I want a clean, standardized theme architecture, so that themes are predictable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining theme files THEN they should follow consistent naming conventions
2. WHEN adding new theme features THEN they should integrate with the existing architecture
3. WHEN reviewing CSS variables THEN they should be properly scoped and organized
4. IF theme code is inconsistent THEN it should be refactored to follow established patterns

### Requirement 5: Ensure Cross-Browser Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user on any modern browser, I want the Creative Gradient theme to display correctly, so that I have a consistent experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge THEN the theme should display identically
2. WHEN using backdrop-filter THEN fallbacks should be provided for unsupported browsers
3. WHEN CSS animations run THEN they should be smooth and performant across browsers
4. IF browser compatibility issues exist THEN they should be addressed with appropriate fallbacks
