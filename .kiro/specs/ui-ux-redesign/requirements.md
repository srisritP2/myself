# UI/UX Redesign Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines a comprehensive UI/UX redesign for the Vue 3 + Vuetify portfolio website to transform it from a basic card-based layout into a modern, professional, and visually appealing portfolio platform. The current design uses a limited yellow/blue color scheme with repetitive stacked card layouts that lack visual hierarchy and modern design patterns.

The redesign focuses on implementing a sophisticated design system with multiple color themes, improved layout patterns, enhanced typography, and contemporary UI elements while maintaining excellent usability and accessibility.
